# Practical_work_ii

This is the Practical Work II webpage to showcase my abilities in HTML and CSS.

## Actions

- Added all the folders and files required.

- Added the content to index.html.

- Completed the About section. Additionally, I made some changes to the index and styles files to improve the website.

- Completed the Contact section with my email address (and a direct link to Gmail so the person can contact me) and my phone number. Also, I edited the CSS file to fit all the new content.

- Completed the Degree section. However, I still need to do the FCE section. I have also updated the CSS stylesheet to accommodate all the new content, alongside some updates to the index.html file, the contact.html file , and the about.html file. The changes in the section are the most relevant, as I have corrected it to fit the instructions. It didn't ask me to do what I did, but to create a kind of box where the user can input some personal data like name and email, plus a box where they can write their message.

- Completed the Topic section. I decided to discuss the history of cybersecurity. Additionally, I made some changes to all the files to fit all the HTML files into one common CSS style.

- Completed the FCE section and began gathering some links from my classmates' webpages for the next section. 

## Design Detailed Document (DDD)

- Description: This webpage has been created to complete the Practical Work II task, with the objective of demonstrating my abilities in the use of HTML and CSS. This is a personal webpage, which means that here you can find information about me, what I study, and a topic chosen by me, which in this case is the history of cybersecurity. This webpage is composed of a CSS stylesheet which contains the visual styles of the webpage, an image folder with the images that you can find on the webpage, a public folder with most of the parts of the webpage (the About Me section , the Degree section , the Topic section ...), and the index file which is the homepage of the webpage.

- Problems during development: The first problem that I confronted in this project was the images because at the beginning I couldn't find a way to fit them correctly on the webpage. Then I had a problem with the contact section because I did something that I wasn ' t supposed to do initially , and then I encountered issues creating the contact box because the styles wouldn 't have any effect on the boxes. I also had some problems finding the information for the purpose section of my degree.

- Conclusions: At the end, this practical work has been one of the most useful , as we had to face some real problems of developing a webpage on our own. It has also been useful to internalize the concepts of HTML and CSS that we will be using in the future.
