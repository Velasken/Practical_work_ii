## Actions

- Added all the folders and files required.
- Added the contant to index.html.
- Completed the about section. Also, I have made some changes to the index and styles files to improve the website.
- Completed the contact section with my email address (and a direct link to gmail so the person can contact me), and my phone number. Also, I have edited the css file to fit all the new content.
- Completed the degree section. However, I still need to do the FCE section. I have also updated the css styles sheet to fit all the new content along side some update to the index.html file, the contact.html file and the about about.html file. The changes on the section are the most relevant, as I have corrected to fit the instructions, because it didn't ask me to do what did, but to create a kind of box were the user can insert some personal data like name and email plus a box were he can write his message.
- Completed the Topic section. I have decided to talk about the history of cybersecurity. Also, I have made some changes to all the files to fit all the html files into one common css style.
- Completed the FCE section and started to get some links from my class mates webpages for the net section.
