                <h2>History of Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>A captivating adventure since the mid-1950s, marked by many important milestones and continual evolvement of threats to security, found its first lab beginnings with the development of networks for computers. The computers brought forth needs for protection against unwarranted access and hostile activities as they grew. In 1971, the world was introduced to the first computer virus known as Creeper. It was quite harmless as it only displayed a message in the infected machines. However, it indicated that there was a chance for malicious software. The first anti-virus program, Reaper, was implemented for the eradication of Creeper and so it commenced the ongoing fight between malware and security software.<img src="../images/Ciber.png" alt="Cibersecurity Icon" class="Ciber-icon"><br><br> 
                The period of the eighties and nineties was significant in many changes regarding cyber attacks. The most memorable one was the Morris Worm in 1988 that set a pattern for what was meant to be the first significant denial of service (DoS) attacks, paralyzing close to 10% of the computers linked to Arpanet, the initial stage towards what today is called the modern internet. This period also showed increased variety concerning kinds of malware, with viruses like Melissa and Love Bug going through great damage and lessons learned about interconnected systems' vulnerability.<br><br>
                The emergence of the internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s ushered in a new chapter in cybersecurity. The rapid proliferation of the internet had created an environment ripe for cybercriminals, who would soon become well coordinated and increasingly sophisticated. In an inspiring twist of events, the hacking group Anonymous emerged in 2003, which became known for its large-scale cyber-attacks and activism. Their activities have shed light on the power and significance of organized cyber groups. Operation is one of the greatest binary incidents of the '00s, having begun with cyber attack series against some of the biggest American companies, for example, Google and Adobe, in 2009. It surpassed previous attacks in sophistication and underlined the multiplying capacities of cyber adversaries, resulting in increased investments by corporations and governments in response to the need for better security in the virtual sphere.<br><br>
                In terms of event, it does have some evidence that the drama of avian flu affected the change in nature that the cyber attack would take with the uptick on ransom demands and increased phishing-a signature of advanced persistent threats. Events such as the Kim Komando Show WannaCry Ransomware Attack in 2017 practically feed for the global melodrama about such incidents and damage amounts that run to billions of dollars. This decade also experienced a sharper focus on data protection and privacy, for example, with the rollout of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which may cover minor safeguards for personal data.<br><br>
                Still, cyber security is a major concern today given that new technologies emerge and cover their risks. This proliferation into everything from practice to technology indicates the nature of the industry's aim of protecting information systems from unauthorized access, interception, and damage. The importance of cyber security would only be magnified in terms of guarding integrity as it would evolve further in the future through continuing efforts to develop better defenses to counter future attacks by adversaries.</p>
