                    <u><h2>Content</h2></u>
                            <p>This subject is structured into two main parts: the theoretical and the practical. The theoretical part begins with an exploration of the historical background of Computer Engineering, providing an understanding of its evolution from the past to the present while projecting its future. It covers key terminologies and concepts, the evolution of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and the role of Computer Engineering as both an academic discipline and a professional field. This section also emphasizes the anthropological and ethical foundations of the field.</p><img src="../images/FCE.png" alt="FCE Icon" class="FCE-icon">
                            <p>Moving on to information and data, the subject examines how information is represented and organized within computer systems. It introduces fundamental concepts such as number systems, data coding, and models, alongside contemporary topics like Big Data, data protection, and the legal and ethical challenges surrounding information management.</p>
                            <p>The subject then explores the structure and functionality of computer systems, including hardware, software, operating systems, and networks. It investigates modern paradigms and technologies such as cloud computing, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, smart cities, and the Internet of Things (IoT), highlighting their interconnected roles in modern computing landscapes.</p>
                            <p>In the practical part, we are introduced to software development and management, including the use of version control systems like Git and GitHub, as well as integrated development environments (IDEs). Students gain hands-on experience in web development, learning to create HTML5 web pages, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and design and layout web pages using CSS3.</p>
